This is a simple word game that works on the console.
I used Java Language to build it.

Here are the rules of the game.

1. The game starts with the program selecting a five letter word at random.
2. Once a word has been played, the letters in that word can not be used in subsequent rounds.
3. The player then guesses five letter words that do not use any of the letters that have been played so far.
4. Game play continues until no words are left that make use of any of the remaining letters.
